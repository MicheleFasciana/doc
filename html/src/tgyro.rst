TGYRO
=====

TGYRO is a parallel transport manager with the ability to call multiple instances of GYRO and NEO in order to obtain steady-state temperature and density profiles. It has the capability to include

- turbulent fluxes from GYRO, TGLF or the simple IFS-PPPL model.
- neoclassical fluxes from NEO, or from simple Hinton-Hazeltine theory.
