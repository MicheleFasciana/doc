NEO
===

NEO is a multi-species drift-kinetic solver which enables a first-principles solution
of the local neoclassical transport problem. It has the capability to treat

- any number of Maxwellian species with arbitrary charge and mass.
- full collisional coupling of all species using the full linearized Fokker-Planck collision operator
- rapid toroidal rotation (including centrifugal effects)
- general (shaped) or simple circular plasmas
- experimental or user-defined physical parameters.
