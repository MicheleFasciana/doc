ZETA
----

**Definition**

Squareness, :math:`\zeta`, of the flux surface.
     
**Comments**
  
- This is only active with :doc:`EQUILIBRIUM_MODEL <equilibrium_model>` = 2 (the Miller equilibrium model).
- When experimental profiles are used (:doc:`PROFILE_MODEL <profile_model>` = 2), the squareness as a function of radius is read from input.profiles.
